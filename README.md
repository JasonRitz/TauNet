encrypted peer to peer Raspberry Pi texting

Writen for and tested on a Raspeberry Pi 2B. Sould work on any computer 
with Python 2.7 or later, but is tested and intended for the RP2B. 

This is a class project for my cs300 class at PSU

The program will allow users to text from one raspeberry Pi to another
securly. It is written in Python and uses sockets (tcp/ip) to transfer
RC4 encrypted strings back and forth using a public/private key and a
custome protocal.
